I'm a software engineer, mainly in .NET back-end, with over 8 years of experience, passionate about clean code, software architecture, and developer experience.

I focus on building maintainable APIs using **.NET**, **Clean Architecture**, **DDD**, and **TDD**. I enjoy working in cross-functional teams, mentoring junior developers, and finding practical ways to make codebases more resilient and easier to evolve.

## 🔧 Current Focus

- Building microservices and distributed systems in .NET 8
- Writing integration tests with **xUnit**, **SpecFlow**, and **TestContainers**
- Applying DDD in real-world contexts (aggregates, specs, architecture boundaries)
- Supporting developer workflows through CI/CD (Azure DevOps, Docker)
- Sharing knowledge internally through **DevTalks** and documentation

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Languages:**
C#, JavaScript / TypeScript, Kotlin, SQL

**Frameworks:**
.NET 8+, EF Core, Angular 18

**Architecture & Methodologies:**
Clean Architecture, DDD, TDD, SOA, Microservices, Agile (Scrum)

**Testing:**
xUnit, SpecFlow, Moq, TestContainers

**Tools & Platforms:**
Azure DevOps, Docker, Git, Jenkins, Visual Studio, VS Code
